#' Simulated sugar (glucose) levels for 100 residents of a hypothetical neighborhood A

#' @Description  Simulated individual fasting blood sugar levels (mg/dL) drawn from 
#'     a normal distribution. Generally, normal fasting blood sugar level are 
#'     between 70–100 mg/dL; levels in the range 100–125 mg/dL are considered pre-diabetes. 
#'     These data and sugar.levels.B are used in the Unit 4 lab of
