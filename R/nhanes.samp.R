#' @description. The dataset NHANES (US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study) is
#'     part of the CRAN package NHANES (author Randall Purim, rpruim@calvin.edu) and contains 76
#'     variables on 100,000 participants from surveys conducted between 2009 and 2012.
#'     The surveys are part of a series conducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics
#'     (NCHS) since the 1960's.   See the NHANES package documentation for more
#'     information about the surveys.  The dataset NHANES is a weighted sample from
#'     the full survey dataset constructed so that it may be treated as a random sample
#'     of the US population. The dataset nhanes.samp contains data from a random sample of size
#'     200 from NHANES and all 76 variables.  See the NHANES package for variable definitions
#'     and coding.
