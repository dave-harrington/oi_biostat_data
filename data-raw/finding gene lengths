While I haven't found a way to limit the results to the canonical transcript only, you can get a list of genes, transcripts and their CDS lengths using Ensemble's BioMart. I have already set it up for you, you can see the results, and modify them, here (click on the "Results" link if you don't see them).

Essentially, you just need to go to BioMart, and

select "Ensembl Genes 96" (the number will change if the version changes) as the database and "uman Genes" as the dataset.

Click on "Filters", and set Gene type to coding and Transcript type to protein_coding.

From "Attributes", select whatever you want to see. The "CDS Length" is under "Structures".

Note structures no long an option
